The goal of this project is to create a graphical replication of the ROBLOX studio for use in game. The exact details of this project still need to be sorted out, please participate in the discussion on [the issue manager](https://github.com/ROBLOX/studio/issues). The project was started by members of [the Scripter's Guild on ROBLOX](http://www.roblox.com/groups/group.aspx?gid=828494), but is not endorsed by or affiliated with the guild.

The idea of the project is to create a studio (using ROBLOX's GUI objects) that can be used to create games in a ROBLOX game server. The purpose is to make it possible for this to be done by many players, together, so that many people can collaborate on a game at the same time, or so a person can teach or show something to another person, or even so a person can use the studio to debug his game in online mode.
